# Red-Velvet-Cake
To make the red velvet cake:
1.	Preheat oven to 350째F (177째C). 
2.	In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Keep aside.
3.	In another bowl, mix cream/butter and sugar together. Add the eggs and mix until fully combined, then mix in the oil, red food color, vanilla extract, and vinegar stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
4.	Mix in the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the buttermilk, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Make sure to mix each addition until just combined and be careful not to over mix the batter.
5.	Evenly distribute the cake batter between the two prepared cake pans and spread the batter around into one even layer. Tap the pans on the counter 2-3 times to remove any air bubbles from the cakes.
6.	Bake at 350째F (177째C) for 28-32 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Carefully remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool in the pans for 15-20 minutes. Then, carefully remove the cakes from the cake pans and place on the wire rack to cool completely. 

To make the cream cheese frosting:
1.	In the large mixing bowl using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the butter and mix for about 30 seconds-1 minute until well combined and smooth. 
2.	Mix in the powdered sugar and vanilla extract and continue mixing until fully combined.
